# Exploring-the-Relationship-between-City-Area-and-Population
In this Data Science project, we aim to explore the relationship between the geographical area and population of cities within a specific region. To achieve this, we will extract relevant data, preprocess it for analysis, and perform data visualization using scatter plots.
Data Extraction:
We will source the data on city areas and populations from reliable datasets, governmental sources, or APIs. The dataset will include information on each city's geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), area in square kilometers, and population size.

Data Preprocessing:
Before visualization, we will clean the dataset, handling any missing or erroneous values. We may also normalize the data if necessary to ensure meaningful comparisons between city areas and populations.

Scatter Plotting:
Using the Matplotlib library, we will create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between city area and population. We will plot each city as a point on a 2D plane, with the x-axis representing the city area and the y-axis representing the population. The size and color of each point may be adjusted to convey additional information, such as population density or other city attributes.

Insights and Interpretation:
Through the scatter plots, we will be able to identify any patterns or trends between city area and population. We may also apply additional techniques, such as fitting a regression line, to assess the strength of the relationship. The project aims to provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, or researchers interested in understanding the dynamics between city size and population.

By employing data visualization techniques, this project seeks to offer a clear and intuitive representation of the relationship between city area and population, enabling informed decision-making and further analysis in urban planning and development.
